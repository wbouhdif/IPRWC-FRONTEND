# IPRWC Webshop Project

## Overview
This project is a front-end webshop application developed for the IPRWC school project. Built with Angular, this application offers a user interface displaying a range of burgers loaded through a back-end service (See IPRWC-Backend). The application is was designed for me to practise developing a full-stack webapp.

## Features
- **Product Display**: Products are dynamically loaded from the back-end.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality.
- **JWT Token Integration**: Implements JWT for secure transmission of information between the client and server.
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: All the displayed products have CRUD functionality if you are logged in as a admin ofcourse.
- **Shopping Cart**: A fully functional cart system, allowing users to add, remove, and review products before purchase.
